### 🧬 About Me

Hey there! I’m Yeasin.  
I don’t really like calling myself just a "developer" — I’m more like someone who gets curious about how things work and ends up turning that curiosity into code.

I started coding out of curiosity, and now I can’t imagine a day without it.  
Most of my time goes into solving problems, building things that probably no one asked for, and learning something new along the way.

I spend time doing competitive programming on [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/yanayem), and when I’m not doing that, I’m building web projects.  
You can check out my projects here:
- 🌐 [Vercel Projects](https://vercel.com/yeasin-arafats-projects-e284b126)
- 💻 [Netlify Projects](https://app.netlify.com/teams/arafatnayem01/projects)
- 🎨 [Creative stuff on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Yeasin-Arafat-Nayem-Bhuiyan)

A few things about me:
- 🧠 Self-taught and always learning  
- 🛠️ Love building tools that *actually* solve problems  
- 🌊 I enjoy blending logic and creativity  
- 🧩 My comfort zone: **Python + C++**
